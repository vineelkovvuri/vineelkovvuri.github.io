      <description>Introduction Compilers are surely the complex programs of all times. Even today, writing a compiler with minimum set of tools is considered to be challenging. This tutorial scratches the surface of different compiler phases involved in translating a given source code to executable and also shows how this information is useful in context of reverse engineering.&#xA;GNU compiler collection provides an excellent set of tools for dissecting the compilation process and to understand the working of bits and bytes in the final executable.</description>
