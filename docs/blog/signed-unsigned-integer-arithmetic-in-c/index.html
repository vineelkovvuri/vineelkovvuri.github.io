<main>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This article is about understanding how integer conversions happen in C
language. The C standard defines the integer conversion rules agnostic to
any specific machine architecture. This also makes things more complicated
for programmers to understand.</p>
<p>First of all, Why do we need integer conversions at all? The answer is
simple, we need to have single type for any given expression. Let&rsquo;s say we
have an expression <em><expr1><op><expr2></em> when expr1 and expr2 are of
different types, we want the resulting expression from this to have one
single type.</p>
<p>The C99 specification defines below set of integer types as &lsquo;standard
integer types&rsquo;. Interestingly, the sizes of these integer types are not
defined at all. It only defines the minimum supported size. For example, int
need not be 8 bytes long on x64 platforms. The only definition for int is,
it should have at least 16 bits and similarly long should have at least 32
bits, it need not be 8 bytes long. Depending on the platform, processor
architecture, ABI (Application Binary Interface) and the programming model,
the size of these basic types are determined. Windows x64 follows
LLP64(meaning only &rsquo;long long&rsquo; and pointer size are 64 bit wide), So below
are the sizes of the standard types that we are sticking to in this article.</p>
<pre><code>Type                | Size
--------------------+---------
signed char         | 1 bytes
unsigned char       | 1 bytes
signed short        | 2 bytes
unsigned short      | 2 bytes
signed int          | 4 bytes
unsigned int        | 4 bytes
signed long         | 4 bytes
unsigned long       | 4 bytes
signed long long    | 8 bytes
unsigned long long  | 8 bytes
</code></pre>
<p>Also, The specification leaves other aspects of C language definition
undefined and this leave room for optimizations for compilers. For example,
the result of signed arithmetic leading to overflow/underflow is not defined
because the specification predates to the machine architectures when 2&rsquo;s
complement representation for -ve numbers is not universal, even though
virtually every modern architecture now uses 2&rsquo;s complement representation
for -ve numbers. Hence the result of unsigned overflow/underflow is well
defined but not signed overflow/underflow!</p>
<h1 id="how-signed-ness-is-represented-in-the-hardware">How signed-ness is represented in the hardware?</h1>
<p>Processors do have the concept of signed/unsigned, but unlike in C language,
where this information is baked into the variable definition, processor
registers do not hold the type/signed/unsigned information. After all,
registers are just placeholders of data. But by contrast, the instructions
themselves do have the notion of signed/unsigned. That is why we have signed
&lsquo;imul&rsquo;, unsigned &lsquo;mul&rsquo;, signed (JL/JG) vs unsigned(JB/JA) jump instructions.
This is an important distinction between programming languages and machine
code. It helps in understanding how high-level code gets translated to
underlying machine code. Instructions which produce/consume signed data
understand that -ve numbers should be in 2&rsquo;s complement form. So if a
register (8bit) has 11110110, it&rsquo;s up to the instruction to treat that data
as either -10 (signed) or 246 (unsigned). If an operation results in a -ve
result say -5 then destination register will be written 11111011(2&rsquo;s
complement representation of -5). &lsquo;add&rsquo; and &lsquo;sub&rsquo; instructions themselves
are not affected by signed and unsigned numbers because of modulo
arithmetic.</p>
<h1 id="how-signed-ness-is-interpreted-in-assembly">How signed-ness is interpreted in assembly?</h1>
<p>In one of the above paragraphs, we said, processor registers does not hold
any signed/unsigned type information with them and it&rsquo;s up to the
instructions to interpret the data as either signed or unsigned. But the
interesting thing about x86/x64 processors is, they provide a flag
register(EFLAGS) where some of the bits are called <strong>Status Flags</strong>. These
Status Flags represent the status of arithmetic operations the happened with
the previous instruction.</p>
<p>The most important flags of these for our discussion are</p>
<ol>
<li>Carry flag - Set if an arithmetic operation generates a carry or a
borrow out of the most significant bit of the result; cleared otherwise.
This flag indicates an overflow condition for unsigned-integer
arithmetic.</li>
<li>Sign flag - Set equal to the most significant bit of the result, which
is the sign bit of a signed integer. (0 indicates a positive value and 1
indicates a negative value.)</li>
<li>Overflow flag - Set if the integer result is too large a positive number
or too small a negative number (excluding the sign-bit) to fit in the
destination operand, cleared otherwise. This flag indicates an overflow
condition for signed-integer (two&rsquo;s complement) arithmetic</li>
</ol>
<p>Of the above three status flags, Carry flag is obvious but other two flags need
some explanation. Sign flag is set irrespective of whether you are treating the
numbers as positive or negative, All it cares is if the result&rsquo;s MSB is set or
not.</p>
<p>For example in below code, &lsquo;sub&rsquo; can treat 0x81 as -127 or +129. So the
result can also be either interpreted as -128 or +128, But the processor
after executing &lsquo;sub&rsquo; instruction indicates this possibility in Sign Flag.
So operations(JA/JB) who want to treat the result an unsigned will ignore
this sign flag whereas operations (like JG/JL) who treat it as signed will
take this sign flag into account.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Overflow flag is a little different. First of all, the Overflow flag is not
set when an operation results in an overflow of the number that can be
represented in a register. Like for example, if we try to add 1 to 0xff does
not set this bit.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-nasm" data-lang="nasm"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#06b;font-weight:bold">mov</span> <span style="color:#038">al</span>, <span style="color:#00d;font-weight:bold">0xFF</span> // <span style="color:#00d;font-weight:bold">0b</span><span style="color:#00d;font-weight:bold">11111111</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Overflow flag is mainly meant for indicating if there is a chance of result if
interpreted as signed will cross beyond what can be represented in the register.
For example, if we take a byte(al) it can contain value from 0b00000000(0) to
0b11111111(255) as unsigned or 0b10000000(-128) to 0b01111111(127) as signed
number. Now overflow flag is set when a result goes beyond 0b01111111 i.e., too
large a positive number and less than 0b10000000 i.e., too small a negative
number</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-nasm" data-lang="nasm"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#06b;font-weight:bold">mov</span> <span style="color:#038">al</span>, <span style="color:#00d;font-weight:bold">0x7e</span> // <span style="color:#369">This</span> <span style="color:#369">is</span> <span style="color:#038">al</span><span style="color:#369">ways</span> <span style="color:#369">positive</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Let us see how overflow flag is used to determine the below conditional when
var1 and var2 are signed numbers.</p>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The above code is translated to cmp followed by jl. cmp does var1-var2. And jl
says execute printf if SF != OF. Now lets see the combinations why SF needs to
be not equal to OF</p>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>var1 - var2 =&gt; -<span style="color:#00d;font-weight:bold">135</span> =&gt; which cannot be represented in a byte meaning the
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>                        sign bit of the byte will not be set but the overflow
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>                        bit gets set. So SF=<span style="color:#00d;font-weight:bold">0</span> and OF=<span style="color:#00d;font-weight:bold">1</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>var1 = -<span style="color:#00d;font-weight:bold">120</span>;

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>var1 - var2 =&gt; -<span style="color:#00d;font-weight:bold">20</span> =&gt; this can be represented in a byte and its -ve so SF = <span style="color:#00d;font-weight:bold">1</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>                        but because it is still under the range of singed
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>                        numbers representable in a byte OF = <span style="color:#00d;font-weight:bold">0</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>That is why jl is defined as SF != OF, When this is true it means var1 &lt; var2
even if var1 and var2 are signed(meaning -ve numbers)</p>
<h1 id="signed-vs-unsigned-integers-in-c">Signed vs Unsigned integers in C</h1>
<p>Signed numbers are the way -ve and +ve numbers are represented and unsigned
numbers are the way in which only +ve numbers are represented. If let&rsquo;s say
a data type has 1 byte of storage then the possible bit representation will
be from 0b00000000 (0) - 0b11111111(255). Now, these 255 valid slots can be
interpreted as all positive numbers or divide the range into two halves and
call one half of the slot as positive and other as negative numbers. There
are other alternate representations for -ve numbers but almost all systems
use 2&rsquo;s complement notation to represent -ve numbers. The take away here is
if we include -ve numbers in the available 255 slots then we will represent
from -128 to 127. According to 2&rsquo;s complement notation -128 is represented
as 0b10000000(0x80) whereas 127 is represented as 0b01111111 (0x7F).</p>
<h1 id="integer-arithmetic-conversions-in-c">Integer Arithmetic Conversions in C</h1>
<p>C language defines below set of rules to convert the arguments in an expression.</p>
<h2 id="rank">Rank</h2>
<p>Every integer type has an integer conversion rank defined as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>No two signed integer types shall have the same rank, even if they have
the same representation.</li>
<li>The rank of a signed integer type shall be greater than the rank of any
signed integer type with less precision.</li>
<li>The rank of long long int shall be greater than the rank of long int,
which shall be greater than the rank of int, which shall be greater than
the rank of short int, which shall be greater than the rank of signed char.</li>
<li>The rank of any unsigned integer type shall equal the rank of the
corresponding signed integer type, if any.</li>
<li>The rank of any standard integer type shall be greater than the rank of
any extended integer type with the same width.</li>
<li>The rank of char shall equal the rank of signed char and unsigned char.</li>
<li>The rank of Bool shall be less than the rank of all other standard
integer types.</li>
<li>The rank of any enumerated type shall equal the rank of the compatible
integer type (see 6.7.2.2).</li>
<li>The rank of any extended signed integer type relative to another
extended signed integer type with the same precision is
implementation-defined, but still subject to the other rules for
determining the integer conversion rank.</li>
<li>For all integer types T1, T2, and T3, if T1 has greater rank than T2 and
T2 has greater rank than T3, then T1 has greater rank than T3. At a high
level the gist of above rules is as follows</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Rank(signed char) == Rank(unsigned char) &lt; Rank(signed short) == Rank(unsigned
short) &lt; Rank(signed int) == Rank(unsigned int) &lt; Rank(signed long) ==
Rank(unsigned long) &lt; Rank(signed long long) == Rank(unsigned long long)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="integer-promotions">Integer Promotions</h2>
<p>The following may be used in an expression wherever an int or unsigned int may be
used:</p>
<ul>
<li>An object or expression with an integer type whose integer conversion rank
is less than or equal to the rank of int and unsigned int.</li>
<li>A bit-field of type Bool, int, signed int, or unsigned int.</li>
<li>1a) If an int can represent all values of the original type, the value is
converted to an int;</li>
<li>1b) otherwise, it is converted to an unsigned int. These are called the
integer promotions. All other types are unchanged by the integer
promotions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="usual-arithmetic-conversions">Usual arithmetic conversions</h2>
<ul>
<li>2a) If both operands have the same type, then no further conversion is
needed.</li>
<li>2b) Otherwise, if both operands have signed integer types or both have
unsigned integer types, the operand with the type of lesser integer
conversion rank is converted to the type of the operand with greater
rank.</li>
<li>2c) Otherwise, if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank
greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand, then the
operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand
with unsigned integer type.</li>
<li>2d) Otherwise, if the type of the operand with signed integer type can
represent all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned
integer type, then the operand with unsigned integer type is converted
to the type of the operand with a signed integer type.</li>
<li>2e) Otherwise, both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type
corresponding to the type of the operand with signed integer type.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rule-2c-interpretation">Rule 2c interpretation</h3>
<p>The gist of 2c is to make sense of expressions like z = a+b where a is
singed number and b is unsigned number. Now a 4 byte signed int is added to
8 byte unsigned long long, according to this rule, a 4 byte signed int will
become 8 byte unsigned long long. The important point to remember here is
conversion of signed int to unsigned long long. The way the compiler does
this is by sign extend 4 byte signed number so that its absolute value will
not change i.e.., -10 remain -10 whether it is a 4 byte or 8 byte. But
according to these rules the expression will have the type unsigned long
long so statements like below will result in unexpected behavior. Since the
var1+var2 is an unsigned expression the compiler will enforce it by using a
unsigned jump instruction called jae instead of jge instruction.</p>
<pre><code>                .----------------This bit will sign extend to all 1's
                11111011            signed short a = -5
        1111111111111011            unsigned int a = -5
      + 0000000000001010            unsigned int b = 10
      = 0000000000000101            unsigned int
Figure 1: signed number converted to unsigned numbers
</code></pre>
<p>Whenever a signed data type has to be converted to unsigned data type the
absolute value remains unchanged because sign extension will be done using
movsx instruction. So if a variable is type signed short with value -10,
when this variable is sign extended to unsigned int the value of even after
the conversion remains -10 when interpreted as singed int because the binary
represent for -10 for 2 byte storage and 4 byte storage yields the same.</p>
<p>godbolt&rsquo;s compiler explorer is very helpful in understanding how the compiler
translates expressions and apply the above rules. Clang AST view especially
helps in graphically looking at how these promotions/conversion happen</p>

statement one at a time. It cannot determine the type of the complete
statement at once, because of this, we might end up with unexpected results
if we are not careful enough about how the type is propagated. For example,
in var = exp1 + exp2<em>exp3 the rules can only tell how exp2</em>exp3 interact and
how that result interacts with exp1. exp2*exp3&rsquo;s new type may not gel well
with exp1 and might result in an unexpected result.</p>

<p>Rule 2d tries to make sense when you have two variables unsigned
number(smaller) and signed number in an expression and the singed storage
can hold the unsigned number entirely, then by this rule, the unsigned
number gets converted to signed number.</p>
