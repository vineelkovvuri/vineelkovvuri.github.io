# VINEEL KOVVURI

**Hi!** I'm **Vineel Kovvuri**, currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at **Microsoft** in Redmond, Washington. With around 13 years of experience, I graduated with a Master's degree from **IIIT Hyderabad**. I love teaching, hence I've created this website to share that passion at no cost :)
