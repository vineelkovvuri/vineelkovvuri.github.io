I think it's high time I express my long overdue gratitude for the software that
I rely on every day to make both my personal and professional life easier.

Below are some of the tools I have been using for almost 20 years:

1. [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/) - Thank you, David Carpenter. Without you, Windows is unusable for power users.
2. [System Informer](https://systeminformer.sourceforge.io/) (formerly Process Hacker) - Thank you. I am not sure how much I owe you.
3. [FSCapture](https://www.faststone.org/FSCaptureDetail.htm) - Thank you. I have been using it since 2006. The best screenshot tool on Windows.
4. [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) - Thank you. Without you, life would have been terrible!
5. [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html) - Thank you. You made the impossible possible!
6. [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - Thank you. You changed the way I edit text. Long live multi-cursors!
7. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Thank you. Without your global find and replace pane, life would have been terrible!
8. [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) - Thank you. You have been with me ever since I started using computers in 1998!
9. [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) - Thank you. You made searching within files fast and efficient!
10. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Thank you. I am still a Git command line user!
11. [Meld](https://sourceforge.net/projects/meld-installer/) - Thank you. From 2012 until last year, I used Meld for Git and other needs.
12. [WinMerge](https://winmerge.org/) - Thank you. I finally switched to WinMerge on Windows.

Finally, Windows and I have a love and hate relationship. Thanks for the chaos,
the magic, and everything in between.

Happy Thanksgiving to all!
