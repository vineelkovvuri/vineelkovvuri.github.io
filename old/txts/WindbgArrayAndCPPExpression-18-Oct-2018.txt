Today when debugging an RPC msrc I used below debugger commands to traverse an
array of structures.

dt -a RPCRT!ABC <address> -r1

also used dqs with a function pointer array to list the pointers along with their
symbols

C++ Expression evaluator
dc @@C++(pStubMsg->RpcMsg->Buffer) L@@C++(pStubMsg->RpcMsg->BufferLength/4)
The above command simply displays buffer contains until its length /4 is needed
because dc display quadwords and L is followed the object count not byte count
