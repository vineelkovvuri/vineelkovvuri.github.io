<b>Below example show that we can indeed declare a character constant with more than one character (up to 4 chars max)</b>

<b>int main()</b>
<b>{</b>
    unsigned int tag = 'Riya'; // At the max we can have 4 characters

<b>#if 0</b>
    6.4.4.4 Character constants
        An integer character constant has type int.The value of an integer character constant
        containing a single character that maps to a single - byte execution character is the
        numerical value of the representation of the mapped character interpreted as an integer.
        The value of an integer character constant containing more than one character(e.g.,
        'ab'), or containing a character or escape sequence that does not map to a single - byte
        execution character, is implementation - defined.If an integer character constant contains
        a single character or escape sequence, its value is the one that results when an object with
        type char whose value is that of the single character or escape sequence is converted to
        type int.
<b>#endif</b>

    printf("\n%x ", tag); // This will print 0x52697961 Riya
    return 0;
<b>}</b>

<b>In Windows, ExAllocatePoolWithTag accepts a tag as an integer as its parameter.</b>
<b>The usage of this API by the callers uses the above technique to tag the allocated</b>
<b>block of memory with something meaningful</b>
